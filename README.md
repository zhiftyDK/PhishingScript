# How to use
Run the script with:
```bash
py phishing.py --page WEBSITENAME
```

Put your phishing `website.html` files into a folder called website in the same directory as the script
The `WEBSITENAME` will correspond to the name of the html file without the `.html`

Have fun, and dont do any crimes, i will not take responsebility for it :)
